3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,080
much faster than ever before.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,960
But an application can require prompting an LLM multiple times and parsing its output,
但一个应用程序可能需要多次提示LLM并解析其输出、

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,080
and so there's a lot of glue code that needs to be written.
因此，有很多胶水代码需要编写。

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,600
LLM for Large Language Model Application Development, created by Harrison Chase, makes this development

It came about when I was talking to a bunch of folks in the field who were building more
它是在我与该领域的一群人交谈时产生的，这些人正在建立更多的

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,280
complex applications and saw some common abstractions in terms of how they were being developed.
复杂的应用程序，并在如何开发方面看到了一些共同的抽象概念。

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,880
And we've been really thrilled at the community adoption of LangChain so far, and so look

it.
它。

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,080
And in fact, as a sign of LangChain's momentum, not only does it have numerous users, but

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,280
there are also many hundreds of contributors to the open source.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,860
And this has been instrumental for its rapid rate of development.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,920
This team really ships code and features at an amazing pace.

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,000
cool applications using LangChain.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,760
And who knows, maybe you even decide to contribute back to the open source LangChain effort.
谁知道呢，也许你甚至决定回馈给开源的LangChain工作。

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,660
LangChain is an open source development framework for building LLM applications.

26
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,920
We have two different packages, a Python one and a JavaScript one.
我们有两个不同的包，一个是Python包，一个是JavaScript包。

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,720
They're focused on composition and modularity.
他们专注于组成和模块化。

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,600
So they have a lot of individual components that can be used in conjunction with each

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,640
other or by themselves.

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,800
And then the other key value add is a bunch of different use cases.

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,960
So chains of ways of combining these modular components into more end-to-end applications
因此，将这些模块化组件组合成更多的端到端应用的方法链

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,160
and making it very easy to get started with those use cases.
